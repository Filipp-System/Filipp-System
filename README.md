This is currently the main calc project. Todo:
	- need to cleanup
	- move the files from the top project except the authentication/authorization because it will be reworked
	- after i have a good overview this readme file must be removed and our kanban board gets some tasks
	- never forget how important the kanban part is. This is our documentation and the version control ofc 
		but the CEO won't have the time to learn a version control system just because we have a good documentation here. 
Solution:
	- check if good tools exists which can create docus from version controls or kanbans or maybe out of vs and kanban linked together. Task to vs pull request (only if the pull request in reviewed and accepted)
	- the source for the docu should therefore only be the master branch

Short Planing which handles the following topics:
	- .NET 5 Migration
	- .NET 6 Migration (currently in preview 5, so it will land on a feature branch meanwhile)
	- very important for me: i need to go through the .NET 6 patchnotes and see where we can get some benefit
	- rework the blazor webassembly frontend files to get < 5% code duplication
		means:
			-- working with pages which can be replaced at livetime
			-- creating templates soon
			-- we can upload the page at github "pages" checked it today and looks awesome
	- also i'll keep an eye on gRPC and maybe build a little proof of concept tool where i will create a checklist before with features we need create a szenario in the PoC Project

Thats it with the list for the first .. now i feel how my head lost some pounds of swirling weight
