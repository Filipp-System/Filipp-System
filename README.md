# Filipp.System Application

Filipp System is a big idea which starts small. Our goal is to create a software which offers a solution to a problem many companies right now have. The project owner is also CEO of such a company where he have many ideas how the workflow could be made smarter by a piece of software. We want to help the employees do their job in a more comfortable way. Meanwhile we want to build the software in a more generic way, where we can help many companies with the whole software. But it's very important for us to not just build some software. We want to build a piece of good software. We have many years of expierence in software development from the scratch. So we take an eye on code quality, testability, performant code, good architecture, smart solutions for different problems. 

For now we could need 1-2 developers who want to be part of something you could make a difference. We don't earn any money at this point but if we do everything right we can create something big. You are free to plan your work time by yourself. There are no sprint goals right now. But if you wish to work agile, you are welcome. We hold 1-2 time a week voice meetings where we dicuss issues or general strategies where your word will take weight. Some bonus: we have the whole JetBrains Toolchain for our OpenSource project. If your are interested feel free to contact me: jjalinski@gmail.com 

If you have any questions regarding the project or the people behind it, feel free buddy.

We'd be glad to hear of you :)
