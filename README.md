# Filipp.System Application	 																											![.NET Core](https://github.com/Filipp-System/Filipp-System/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg?branch=master)	

Filipp System is a big idea which starts small. Our goal is to create a software which offers a solution to a problem many companies right now have: digitalization with a low barrier of entry for all involved. The project owner is also CEO of such a company where he has many ideas on how the workflow could be made smarter by a piece of software. We want to help the employees do their job in a more comfortable way than before to get those who are maybe older or less tech-savvy interested and "into it". Meanwhile we want to build the software in a modular way, so that with time, we can help many companies to obtain the ability to digitize more and more of their workflow without having to rely on heavy weight systems that create a lot of overhead and require extra staff to maintain. It's very important for us to not just build some software. We want to build a piece of good software. We have many years of expierence in software development from scratch. So we take an eye on code quality, testability, performant code, good architecture and smart solutions for different problems. 

For now we could need 1-2 developers who want to be part of something you could make a difference with. We don't earn any money at this point but if we do everything right we can create something big. You are free to plan your work time by yourself. There are no sprint goals right now. But if you wish to work agile, you are welcome. We hold 1-2 voice meetings a week where we dicuss issues or general strategies where your word will take weight. Some bonus: we have the whole JetBrains Toolchain for our OpenSource project. If you are interested feel free to contact me: jjalinski@gmail.com 

If you have any questions regarding the project or the people behind it, feel free buddy.

We'd be glad to hear of you :)
